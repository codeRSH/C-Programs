Linux Input Subsystem

The input subsystem is the part of the Linux kernel that manages the various input devices (such as keyboards, mice, joysticks, tablets and a wide range of other devices) that a user uses to interact with the kernel, command line and graphical user interface. This subsystem is included in the kernel because these devices usually are accessed through special hardware interfaces (such as serial ports, PS/2 ports, Apple Desktop Bus and the Universal Serial Bus), which are protected and managed by the kernel. The kernel then exposes the user input in a consistent, device-independent way to user space through a range of defined APIs.

The Linux input subsystem is a single, harmonized way to manage all input devices. This is a relatively new approach for Linux, with the system being partly incorporated in kernel version 2.4 and fully integrated in the 2.5 development series.

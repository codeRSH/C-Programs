keyman.c

The program keyman is created keeping linux newbies in mind. It provides a quick way to look at brief description, synopsis and format of the command as the user types it. This program requires a screen manager eg GNU Screen which can split the terminal into two regions having different tty file names.

man2.sh is a shell script which is used by keyman. man2.sh redirects output and error stream to the other region (ie tty on which you are not working).

Keyman works in the background, always listening to the "Linux Input Subsystem" [See Appendix for details]. As soon as the command is typed and spacebar is pressed it prints out few selected lines from the man page of the command typed.

If there is no such command or if it is misspelled, it prints the corresponding error. 
For Example : "No manual entry for unmount"
